          <h2>About our removal service</h2>
          <p>For removal, we use our rubber track loader and a dump truck with a container. We load the container with manure and haul it to the nearest certified compost center. We continue until we have taken the number of loads specified by you.</p>
          <p>
            We take most bedding material(s): straw, shredded straw, shavings, pelleted wood
            beddings, and sawdust. We Do not like soaking wet manure please try to keep it out
            the rain.
          </p>
          <p>We also ask that you donâ€™t put plastic, baler twine, soda cans, equine medical debris or debris of any kind in the manure pile.</p>
          <p>ALL payments are due, in full, same day as work is performed. Remember to download our app for the best access to all our products and pricing.</p>
