          <ul>
            <li>It gives all equestrian and landscape companies to have a central location to serve more customers over a more geographically larger area. This allows us to save a significant amount of money in transportation costs and best of all, we pass that savings on to the customer.</li>
            <li>It allows for the small farmer who wants to haul their manure a place to dispose of it and save a little money on their Manure Removal. In addition to that, they can also pick up their bulk horse bedding at the Transfer Station at the same time. This creates an opportunity for double savings.</li>
            <li>Having the Transfer Station allows us to stage the Horse Manure we haul at a central location before we ship it out.</li>
            <li>Do you prefer a Custom Blend of Shavings? The Transfer Station gives us an area to Custom Blend a Shavings mix for you from our many premium products.</li>
            <li>With Palm beach county not having a viable option available for the disposal of Horse Manure, a facility like this will help both the County and the Horseman to have more options and lower costs.</li>
